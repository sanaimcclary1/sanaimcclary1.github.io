            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
            <span class="highlight">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
            <span class="highlight">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
            In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
            <span class="highlight">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."</span>
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
            <span class="highlight">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep . . ."</span>
            And I felt him to be more fragile still.
            <span class="highlight">I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind . . .</span>
